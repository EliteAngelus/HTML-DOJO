        <p id="information">Random information I've pulled from the internet to create something that resembles a website. Here is my introduction. On This Test page I have implemented tags that I have learned on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. The various tags learned have been put together here to form a test page which will allow me to view the changes each tag contributes. Futhermore, The pages information, while non-sensical as a whole, represents what I am currently devoted my free time to and as such provides adaquete filler content for the page. In time, I hope to establish a more structered page that will utilize a bevy of tags to create something that is both pleasing to the eyes but will offer revelent information for the viewer. </p>

        <p id="information">Similar to the previous game, <span class="first-word">Danganronpa 2</span> features two main styles of gameplay; School Life, which is split into Daily Life and Deadly Life sections, and the Class Trial. In the Daily Life section, players interact with other characters and progress through the plot. Conversing with characters during 'Free Time' sections earns Hope Fragments, which can be exc  hanged for skills that can be used in the Class Trial. Performing various interactions increases the player's level, allowing them to equip more skills during trials. Monocoins, earned by finding hidden Monokuma Figures or performing well in trials, can be exchanged for presents that can be given to other characters during Free Time segments, with certain items able to trigger special events. The Deadly Life section, which occurs when a crime scene is discovered, has the player search for evidence that will assist them in the Class Trial. </p>

       <p> <em>Persona</em> 5 is a role-playing video game where the player takes on the role of a silent protagonist, a high school student who lives out a single year while attending high school in Tokyo: Tokyo is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that govern general behavior similar to a social simulation. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events â€” the protagonist attends school, can go to part-time jobs within Tokyo, and pursue leisure activities or create items for use in other areas of the game. These various activities raise character attributes, which in turn grant passive buffing effects during battle.[1][2][3][4] When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships dubbed "Confidant"</p>
