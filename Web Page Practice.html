            <p class="information" ="information">Random information I've pulled from the internet to create something that resembles a website. Here is my introduction. On This Test page I have implemented tags that I have learned on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. The various tags learned have been put together here to form a test page which will allow me to view the changes each tag contributes. Futhermore, The pages information, while non-sensical as a whole, represents what I am currently devoted my free time to and as such provides adaquete filler content for the page. In time, I hope to establish a more structered page that will utilize a bevy of tags to create something that is both pleasing to the eyes but will offer revelent information for the viewer. </p>

            <p class="information" ="information">Similar to the previous game, <span class="first-word">Danganronpa 2</span> features two main styles of gameplay; School Life, which is split into Daily Life and Deadly Life sections, and the Class Trial. In the Daily Life section, players interact with other characters and progress through the plot. Conversing with characters during 'Free Time' sections earns Hope Fragments, which can be exc  hanged for skills that can be used in the Class Trial. Performing various interactions increases the player's level, allowing them to equip more skills during trials. Monocoins, earned by finding hidden Monokuma Figures or performing well in trials, can be exchanged for presents that can be given to other characters during Free Time segments, with certain items able to trigger special events. The Deadly Life section, which occurs when a crime scene is discovered, has the player search for evidence that will assist them in the Class Trial. </p>

                <p class="information"> <em>Persona</em> 5 is a role-playing video game where the player takes on the role of a silent protagonist, a high school student who lives out a single year while attending high school in Tokyo: Tokyo is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that govern general behavior similar to a social simulation. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events â€” the protagonist attends school, can go to part-time jobs within Tokyo, and pursue leisure activities or create items for use in other areas of the game. These various activities raise character attributes, which in turn grant passive buffing effects during battle.[1][2][3][4] When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships dubbed "Confidant"</p>

    <h2 class="titles" id="fighter">Street Fighter V</h2>

    <img class="pictures" src="http://www.fightersgeneration.com/nz3/game/sf5-ryu-key-artwork.jpg" width="700">

    <p class="information">
        <em>Street Fighter</em> V carries on the side-scrolling fighting gameplay of its predecessors, in which two fighters use a variety of attacks and special abilities to knock out their opponent. The game features the EX gauge introduced in Street Fighter III, which builds as the player lands attacks and can be used to either power up special moves or perform super combos known as Critical Arts, although the Focus Attacks from the previous game have been removed. New to this game is the "V-Gauge", which builds as the player receives attacks and adds three new techniques: V-Skills, V-Reversals, and V-Triggers. V-Skills are special attacks unique to each fighter; for example, Ryu can parry an attack while M. Bison can reflect projectiles, some of which build V-Gauge when successfully performed. V-Reversals allow players to use a section of the V-Gauge to perform a counter move whilst being attacked. Finally, V-Triggers use the entire V-Gauge to allow the player to perform a unique ability, such as a temporary damage boost for Ryu's energy balls or added hits to Chun-Li's attacks. Additionally, the Stun Meter, which has been present since Street Fighter III, is made visible under the health bars in this game. The Stun Meter increases when receiving consecutive attacks and will cause the player to become stunned if filled; thus, it encourages players to play offensively when the opponent's Meter is close to full. The game also features an interactive arena, showcasing special animations when a player is defeated at the edge of the arena.
